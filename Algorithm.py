		In initialization, algorithm will be started.
		Global variables are set during this phase before the recursive algorithm.
		
		Returns: A class of which the variable global_result will contain the algorithm's sub-optimal minimum XP.
		
		Running time analysis: Let n be the number of tiles. Take the smallest case: a 5x5 map.
		Under the assumption that the algorithm will path around any lone obstacles, the longest path
		would be from one corner of the map to another; a maximum of 8 tiles crossed. After crossing the 8 tiles,
		it will search for any final requirements. In an average case, this will also be relatively small since it
		does a breadth-first search of the area around it. Therefore, the big O running time will usually be O(log(n)).
		In the worst case, the final requirements needed to fight the boss are on the farthest-most tile from the boss tile.
		Additionally, the path to the boss could be cluttered with 'obstacle walls' that make the algorithm take an
		extreme detour-like path. In this case, the big O running time is O(n). (There are constants of n, but each tile
		is only searched once)
		
		Explanation for global variables:
		-As soon as boss is defeatable with sub-optimal path, make global_finished = True
		-If a requirement loot is found, make global_restart = True
		-Before running algorithm, prioritize gear needed to beat boss.
		-If boss is on top of a hill or on a gate, always try to find that 'specific' requirement first.
		-To make sure a character is always updated to latest recursive call, use global_character.
		-By putting in already searched tiles into global_searched_tiles, function won't revisit the same location
		under the assumption that it's already found the most optimal path to the same tile (not always true).
		-Clear global_searched_tiles when item is found: Incase there's another path available to boss through tiles
		that have already been traversed.

		Comments below outline how the algorithm functions (Warning: Alot of comments).
		Basic Outline: Imagine the maze as a minimum spanning tree. Now instead of immediately creating
		the tree, create the tree as the character moves towards the boss tile. (Creating the tree
		immediately creates a worse algorithm, since the edge weights increase/decrease as the
		character levels up or obtains a weapon.)

		run in constant running time.
		For total recursive calls, the running time is explained in __init()__.
